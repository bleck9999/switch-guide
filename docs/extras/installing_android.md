!!! tip "Installing Android on the Nintendo Switch"
    This page details the installation of Android 11 based on LineageOS onto your Switch. The Switch lacks a cell modem; simply installing Android does not transform your Switch into a tablet that has mobile data with the capability to call people over a mobile network. It can, however, natively run Android programs and games. This installation is not an "Android emulator" of any kind, it is real Android, running directly off of the microSD card.

!!! warning "This will delete everything on your microSD card!"
    This process includes formatting the microSD card, which means all data on it will be lost. Now is a good time to back up *all* of its data to a safe place so that you can restore it later. If you have an emuMMC, follow [these steps](link) to back it up.

This page will detail the setup of the latest release of Switchroot Android, Android 11, for your Nintendo Switch. This page assumes that you have no previous installation, so please do not follow this if you already have Switchroot Android installed on your microSD card, as it will overwrite your data. This page will not detail things such as rooting and overclocking; these types of additions can be found under the [Extras](link) category.
